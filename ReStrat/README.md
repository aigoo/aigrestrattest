#ReStrat
##Reglitch [Codex - Hazak]

###What is ReStrat?

ReStrat is a boss mod for Wildstar, currently in early development. The goal of ReStrat is to have a framework which allows rapid development of strategical aids, such as timers, ability alerts, and so on for progress raiding. 

###Goals

ReStrat is an addon which will see primary use in a progress intensive environment, where information on encounters is sparse. As such the main goals of the addon are as follows:

- Provide the ability to create a boss 'profile' with as little interaction with the base game API as possible.
- Provide tools which allow in detail analysis of encounters.
    - This includes the ability to analyze encounter units,  the actions belonging to them, and the auras gained by all      units.
- Minimal aesthetic which makes efficient use of screen space.
